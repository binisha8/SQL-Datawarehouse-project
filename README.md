# SQL-Datawarehouse-project
ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a modern data warehouse using SQL Server, encompassing ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics. It follows the Medallion Architecture pattern, organizing data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to streamline data processing and analysis.

 Architecture
    The data warehouse architecture is structured as follows:

        i. Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from source systems (e.g., CSV files).
        
        ii. Silver Layer: Cleansed and transformed data, ready for analysis.
        
        ii. Gold Layer: Business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and 
            analytics.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
        Database: Microsoft SQL Server
        
        ETL Tool: T-SQL 
        
        Data Modeling: Star Schema

        Analytics & Reporting: SQL-based queries
